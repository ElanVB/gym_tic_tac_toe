# Tic Tac Toe Gym Environment
# Description
This is a fully vectorized tic tac toe environment for the gym api.
At the moment you can chose to play against a random agent (which is seen as
part of the environment) - you will then need to use the `env.step(action)`
function - or against another agent (the logic of which you must specify) - you
will then need to call `env.half_step(action, player)` for each agent.
